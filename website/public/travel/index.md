# Travel Information
## Getting to and from the Cascadia&nbsp;funtimes

### Planes & Trains

Blaine is a beautiful departure from some of our larger Cascadian tech city centers. The closest airport is Bellingham International Airport.

If you are traveling by air, we recommend flying into Seattle's SeaTac airport, catching the light rail to the Intl District Station using the [Link Light Rail](//www.soundtransit.org/schedules/central-link-light-rail), [walking over to the Amtrak King Street Station](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRn8U) and hopping the [Hacker Bus or Hacker Train](/travel/hackertrain.html) with your fellow Cascadian friends.

HackerBus and HackerTrain tickets are now available! Please see the HackerTrain page for full details and schedule for the various Cascadian centers you are traveling in from.

If you're unable to make the Hacker Train departure, [Amtrak](//amtrak.com) provides a few options to getting you to your destination at Bellingham Amtrak Station (BEL).

### Buses

In addition to the Cascadia HackerBus and HackerTrain options, bus service to and from Bellingham is available via either [BoltBus](//www.boltbus.com) or [GreyHound](//www.greyhound.com).

**If you travel to Bellingham by bus, you will need to arrange your own ride service from the bus station to Semiahmoo Resort.**

While Bellingham and Blaine do not have an Uber presence, these cities do have plenty of well-recommended cab companies: [Rommel's Taxis](//www.yellowpages.com/bellingham-wa/mip/rommels-taxi-474134936) can be reached via phone at [1 (360) 510-1177](tel:13605101177) or [Your Cab Company](http://yourcabco.com/) at [1 (360) 746-4943](tel:13607464943) and are usually very responsive.
