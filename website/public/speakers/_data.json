It will include some (hopefully relatable, but at least interesting) war stories from getting Origami adopted, and getting funding for a team to actually maintain it.</p><p>This talk will explore decisions made by the Origami team, and contrast them with decisions made by other companies (eg lonely planet, gov.uk) when implementing their own pattern libraries / component systems. Hopefully this exploration through other solutions will stop this talk from being too Financial Times focussed, which I don't think is especially interesting for the audience, and keep it relatable.</p><p>By the end of the talk, the listener should understand a bit about how large companies like the FT deal with front end development at scale, and they will hopefully have some ideas about front end architectures to take back to their own worlds.</p>"

        "description": "<p>CSS gets a really bad rap in web development. Some of it is unearned (like snarky comments about “only a front-end developer”), some of it is really criticism about inconsistent browser implementation, and some of it is valid concern about limitations and inconsistencies in CSS itself. No matter where the negative press comes from, the response is the same: we try to solve those problems by improving CSS. Don’t like the fact that there are no loops or logic in CSS? Fix it by using Sass or another preprocessor. Don’t like cross-browser bugs? Fix it by adding Autoprefixer to your workflow. Don’t like limitations? Try to fix it by using not-yet-spec CSS code.</p><p>PostCSS is a tool that tries to fix CSS in multiple ways. It can process Sass-like syntax; it can fix vendor-prefixes, it can almost make pre-spec CSS possible. It’s getting a lot of attention now, so it’s important for us to know how we can use it.</p><p>PostCSS is a powerful tool and it can be a fantastic complement to the preprocessor you’ve already got in your workflow. I believe it’s best to use Sass, Less, or Stylus for compiling any non-CSS to CSS, and to use PostCSS to turn valid CSS into better CSS. There are a few concerns to keep in mind as you integrate PostCSS into your toolkit. As much as possible, only process valid CSS with it and be careful about relying on its ability to emulate non-implemented syntax.</p>"

Today there are new tools in CSS that can help us breathe new life into stale projects. Some of them are cutting edge, while others are quite mature yet still under-used. This talk is centered around the use of emerging CSS tools: grid, shapes, transforms, viewport units, and others.</p><p>Attendees will get a showcase of how these new digital techniques can be applied to the web by journeying back to the past to one of the most notable periods in the history of design: Bauhaus modernism. During this period, design was highly influential yet gleefully experimental, with strict geometry, overlapping elements, and rotated text. Attendees will see works by artist Piet Mondrian, typographer Jan Tschichold, dadaist Kurt Schwitters, and metal-worker Marianne Brandt recreated or redesigned on screen, and optimized for the new medium of mobile devices. By the end, they will have practical examples of how to mix these new tools together to solve old design problems in novel ways—using wisdom from the Bauhaus school.</p>"

Design decisions feel so open ended and exposed, and everyone's a critic. Plus, there is no compiler throwing an error or tests failing if your colors clash. No wonder I’ve seen amazing developers clam up when it’s time to make some design decisions, deferring to “someone creative, who knows more about design” even if I know they want to learn more about design themselves.</p><p>After my presentation, developers will be able to do the basics of color theory, and to feel confident about learning more if they are inspired. How will I do this? The developer way - by abstracting away my domain knowledge as an artist into variables and functions and sharing that information with others. My goal is to demystify design decisions and reveal them to be logical, predictable, and driven by principles that anyone can learn. Designers get something out of this talk too, not only do I encourage every developer in the room to appreciate the domain knowledge designers have to internalize, the many decisions that they have to make, and the hard work it takes to wield color intentionally and skillfully, I also show them how to better communicate these decisions to developers.</p><ul><li>Along the way, we’ll answer a lot of the following questions:</li><li>How can I improve accessibility with my use of color?</li><li>Why are most ‘call to action’ buttons a warm color like red or orange?</li><li>Why shouldn't I use #000000 on my website?</li><li>Why can red and green color schemes troublesome in design?</li><li>What happens if you mix exactly equal parts red and green? How about blue and orange?</li><li>Why do highlights always go on the tops of buttons?</li><li>Why do some colors look good together?</li><li>Why does a color look good in a color picker, but can look so bad when you use it on your site?</li><li>Why does using more white space make things look so much better?</li><li>Why are Sass variables and color functions such an awesome tool for developers?</li></ul><p>Again, this isn’t a talk about how colors make us feel - this is science! I will be talking wavelengths, old school fine art resources, and code!</p>"

(I mean, gulp talks are sooooo 2014, amirite?) There's so much to learn about JavaScript that there are whole Medium posts about how there's so much to learn about JavaScript, and whole conferences to remind you how much you don't know.</p><p>Here's the thing: maybe you're lucky enough to live in this magical world where everything you build is shiny and new, but there are an awful lot of people working on client-side apps that came into being back when yayQuery was a thing and Backbone wasn't. They're building software that serves hundreds of millions of actual users, software that makes actual money, software whose underlying architecture is such that there's rarely such a thing as a “small change,” even as the demand for new features never subsides.</p><p>If you're one of these developers and you're starting to feel like modern JavaScript has left you behind, this talk is for you. I'll share the story of how I started a new job this year by paying a visit to JavaScript circa 2009, back when Ryan Dahl was getting ready to announce Node and Facebook was still four years away from being mocked for the apparent heresy of JSX. I'll explain how I modernized and best-practice-ified a project that didn't even have a package.json, smoothing the development process, eliminating common sources of bugs, paving the way for bigger improvements, and never once uttering the words “we oughta just start from scratch.” </p>"

Client asks for A, server knows the client needs B and C as well, the client gets A B and C. Strategically used, this will allow your server to short-circuit the back-and-forth “waterfall” of requests.</p><p>This technology has a number of significant implications.</p><p>It has the potential to improve performance for single-page applications, especially for clients with high-latency connections (like mobile). It will also make obsolete the bundling strategies used by most modern JavaScript tooling.  Code delivery strategies that take advantage of server push could match or outperform specialized dead code elimination (“tree-shaking”) from tools like Rollup and Webpack.</p><p>HTTP/1.1 has been in use for over twenty years.  That's the era of Netscape 2.0, IE 2.0, Lynx 2.5 (for you grey beards), and the last episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  Let's bring our bundling strategies into the 20th century.</p><p>In this talk, I will:</p><ul><li>Overview HTTP/2 server push and how it works;</li><li>Walk through an example that contrasts performance of an SPA loaded via HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 with server push;</li><li>Summarize the state of affairs for HTTP/2 support on the server-side; and</li><li>Introduce tools and strategies that can help you take advantage of HTTP/2 server push, without sacrificing the power of your current toolset.</li></ul>"

        "description": "The most basic sites don't need servers, and they don't need fancy front end routing. And yet... how did we get here, and why are we so afraid to go back to the basics? Who are we actually building these sites for and who are we harming by front loading so many build tools, complex frameworks, and overblown architecture? Hint: it's not just us, it's out users, too.</p><p>Static sites serve a purpose, and they're really important pieces of the web's history and its future. Static doesn't mean forever unchanged and it doesn't mean you're stuck with a dead site that you can never update. Quite frankly, static sites have gotten a bad reputation and it's not their fault: we've all been so distracted by shiny new things to remember their virtues.</p><p>I'll revisit what it means to build a static site, what the use cases are, how you know its the right technical choice, what tools to use, and when to scale up to something more complex."

For example, when writing APIs in Node.js to be executed in a browser, it's not always clear what your options are–even more so in browser extension development. We'll look closely at some of these details and learn a lot about testing for accessibility in the process, encouraging development of websites that everyone can use.</p>"

In the internet’s early days, places like Livejournal, usenet, and Geocities fostered a kind of freedom and anonymity that is hard to find now. In an era when single-sign-on is king, we are increasingly moving towards tying our faces to data for advertising and marketing purposes, we remove barriers between the digital and the physical. These barrier were often placed for a reason— to explore parts of our identity that we want to keep private. There were opportunities for identity exploration, self-expression, and community, concepts which shift today in the world of web development and open-source.</p><p>So how are we—as designers and developers of the web— responsible for others' identity expression? How does our code help (and hinder) the building of communities which keep us safe and contribute to harassment? Let's wax nostalgic a bit about the internet's early days and ask how much we should care about the products we build, and how users build their identities around those products and our code. </p>"

When you work with an image as your data input, sooner or later you'll encounter the magic term Computer Vision.</p><p>It can be intimidating to get started. At first, that led me to choose a common and powerful library that works like magic in an unfamiliar language (C++). It felt like the library was a black box and I had no control. I started to wonder, what is so magical about computer vision? After all it is just code someone wrote. Can we unravel it? and reconstruct in JavaScript??</p><p>The answer is YES. In this talk, we'll start by getting image data from canvas object, then transform the data to alter an appearance of the image. You will get insight into what data looks like to a browser (hint: it's just an array of numbers !). Next we’ll talk about how to interpret and analyze the data in a meaningful way. Finally, we'll apply what we learned and go through simple image analysis process to build your own AR app in vanilla JavaScript!</p>"
