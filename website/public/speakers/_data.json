It will include some (hopefully relatable, but at least interesting) war stories from getting Origami adopted, and getting funding for a team to actually maintain it.</p><p>This talk will explore decisions made by the Origami team, and contrast them with decisions made by other companies (eg lonely planet, gov.uk) when implementing their own pattern libraries / component systems.

Some of it is unearned (like snarky comments about “only a front-end developer”), some of it is really criticism about inconsistent browser implementation, and some of it is valid concern about limitations and inconsistencies in CSS itself. No matter where the negative press comes from, the response is the same: we try to solve those problems by improving CSS. Don’t like the fact that there are no loops or logic in CSS? Fix it by using Sass or another preprocessor. Don’t like cross-browser bugs? Fix it by adding Autoprefixer to your workflow. Don’t like limitations? Try to fix it by using not-yet-spec CSS code.</p><p>PostCSS is a tool that tries to fix CSS in multiple ways. It can process Sass-like syntax; it can fix vendor-prefixes, it can almost make pre-spec CSS possible. It’s getting a lot of attention now, so it’s important for us to know how we can use it.</p><p>PostCSS is a powerful tool and it can be a fantastic complement to the preprocessor you’ve already got in your workflow. I believe it’s best to use Sass, Less, or Stylus for compiling any non-CSS to CSS, and to use PostCSS to turn valid CSS into better CSS. There are a few concerns to keep in mind as you integrate PostCSS into your toolkit. As much as possible, only process valid CSS with it and be careful about relying on its ability to emulate non-implemented syntax.</p>"

This talk is centered around the use of emerging CSS tools: grid, shapes, transforms, viewport units, and others.</p><p>Attendees will get a showcase of how these new digital techniques can be applied to the web by journeying back to the past to one of the most notable periods in the history of design: Bauhaus modernism. During this period, design was highly influential yet gleefully experimental, with strict geometry, overlapping elements, and rotated text. Attendees will see works by artist Piet Mondrian, typographer Jan Tschichold, dadaist Kurt Schwitters, and metal-worker Marianne Brandt recreated or redesigned on screen, and optimized for the new medium of mobile devices. By the end, they will have practical examples of how to mix these new tools together to solve old design problems in novel ways—using wisdom from the Bauhaus school.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Something that sounds as simple as picking a color palette is often the very thing that scares developers away from diving into design. Design decisions feel so open ended and exposed, and everyone's a critic. Plus, there is no compiler throwing an error or tests failing if your colors clash. No wonder I’ve seen amazing developers clam up when it’s time to make some design decisions, deferring to “someone creative, who knows more about design” even if I know they want to learn more about design themselves.</p><p>After my presentation, developers will be able to do the basics of color theory, and to feel confident about learning more if they are inspired. How will I do this? The developer way - by abstracting away my domain knowledge as an artist into variables and functions and sharing that information with others. My goal is to demystify design decisions and reveal them to be logical, predictable, and driven by principles that anyone can learn. Designers get something out of this talk too, not only do I encourage every developer in the room to appreciate the domain knowledge designers have to internalize, the many decisions that they have to make, and the hard work it takes to wield color intentionally and skillfully, I also show them how to better communicate these decisions to developers.</p><ul><li>Along the way, we’ll answer a lot of the following questions:</li><li>How can I improve accessibility with my use of color?</li><li>Why are most ‘call to action’ buttons a warm color like red or orange?</li><li>Why shouldn't I use #000000 on my website?</li><li>Why can red and green color schemes troublesome in design?</li><li>What happens if you mix exactly equal parts red and green? How about blue and orange?</li><li>Why do highlights always go on the tops of buttons?</li><li>Why do some colors look good together?</li><li>Why does a color look good in a color picker, but can look so bad when you use it on your site?</li><li>Why does using more white space make things look so much better?</li><li>Why are Sass variables and color functions such an awesome tool for developers?</li></ul><p>Again, this isn’t a talk about how colors make us feel - this is science!

Next I'll show some examples of traditional image processing using WebGL. After that, I'll explain how to pass arbitrary data into the GPU and how to retrieve output from those parallel calculations. Finally, there will be an example of this system in action, and then several examples that don't work as expected with explanations of the limitations of the current WebGL architecture.</p>"

        "description": "<p>HTTP/2 is here and it’s supported by all major browsers on mobile and desktop.  But, because of its history, the JavaScript ecosystem is not ready to take advantage.  That’s a pity, but it is also avoidable.</p><p>H2 brings with it a number of features for improving performance: header compression, request multiplexing, shared compression context.</p><p><strong>However, I'd like to focus in on one feature in particular, and how it can make a difference for you: server push.</strong></p><p>Server push is a protocol-level feature that allows your server to send additional assets to the client in response to a request. Client asks for A, server knows the client needs B and C as well, the client gets A B and C. Strategically used, this will allow your server to short-circuit the back-and-forth “waterfall” of requests.</p><p>This technology has a number of significant implications.</p><p>It has the potential to improve performance for single-page applications, especially for clients with high-latency connections (like mobile). It will also make obsolete the bundling strategies used by most modern JavaScript tooling.  Code delivery strategies that take advantage of server push could match or outperform specialized dead code elimination (“tree-shaking”) from tools like Rollup and Webpack.</p><p>HTTP/1.1 has been in use for over twenty years.  That's the era of Netscape 2.0, IE 2.0, Lynx 2.5 (for you grey beards), and the last episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  Let's bring our bundling strategies into the 20th century.</p><p>In this talk, I will:</p><ul><li>Overview HTTP/2 server push and how it works;</li><li>Walk through an example that contrasts performance of an SPA loaded via HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 with server push;</li><li>Summarize the state of affairs for HTTP/2 support on the server-side; and</li><li>Introduce tools and strategies that can help you take advantage of HTTP/2 server push, without sacrificing the power of your current toolset.</li></ul>"

      "bio": "Dr. Nwokedi Idika has nearly a decade of security research experience. After graduating summa cum laude from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2005, he joined Purdue Universityâ€™s Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS). While there, he began with a focus in malware detection and eventually migrated to a focus in security metrics, which ultimately became the focus of his dissertation. He joined what is now MIT Lincoln Laboratoryâ€™s Cyber Security Division in 2011 where he invented algorithms to model, assess, and predict security-relevant phenomena. In addition to algorithm design and development, he also led multiple teams in building prototypes to address cyber security problems of national interest. In April 2014, Dr. Idika joined Shape Security as a Senior Research Scientist.",

        "description": "<p>The Darknet has received significant attention in recent years and with it, increased confusion. Darknet, Dark web, Deep net, Deep web, The Onion Router (TOR) are all used interchangeably. Interestingly enough, none of these terms are actually interchangeable. TOR, the most popular instance of a Darknet, is viewed by many as a tool providing complete anonymization. In reality, the anonymity TOR provides is very specific and far from complete. To appreciate this, one must understand how TOR works and therein lies the problem: most people don’t know how TOR works. So, let’s solve that problem.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how computers see images? Do you want to work on an AR (Augmented Reality) project or build a NodeBot that can recognize and track your face? How about making your own Instagram-like app or finding similer images in Pinterest collection? When you work with an image as your data input, sooner or later you'll encounter the magic term Computer Vision.</p><p>It can be intimidating to get started. At first, that led me to choose a common and powerful library that works like magic in an unfamiliar language (C++). It felt like the library was a black box and I had no control. I started to wonder, what is so magical about computer vision? After all it is just code someone wrote. Can we unravel it? and reconstruct in JavaScript??</p><p>The answer is YES. In this talk, we'll start by getting image data from canvas object, then transform the data to alter an appearance of the image. You will get insight into what data looks like to a browser (hint: it's just an array of numbers !). Next we’ll talk about how to interpret and analyze the data in a meaningful way. Finally, we'll apply what we learned and go through simple image analysis process to build your own AR app in vanilla JavaScript!</p>"
