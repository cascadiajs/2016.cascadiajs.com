            <p>CascadiaFest exists to educate and grow the Javascript community
            in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make
            our community broader and more inclusive, so we're thrilled to be
            able to award Diversity Scholarships for our conference again. What
            does building diversity mean to us? It means encouraging community
            members from any underrepresented group in tech to attend and
            participate. This scholarship is open to residents of the PNW who
            are able to travel to Blaine, WA for August 3-5.</p>

            <p>The recipients of a Diversity Scholarship will receive:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A CascadiaFest ticket to all 3 days of the conference</li>
              <li>Lodging for the nights of August 2, 3, 4 and 5</li>
              <li>Travel to the conference</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you aren't a member of an underrepresented group in tech, we
            ask that you please help us in our outreach efforts. Take a moment
            to share this application with relevant people or organizations.
            If you know of any companies (maybe yours?) that helps fund
            diversity in tech initiatives, feel free to connect them to us at
            info@cascadiajs.com.</p>

            <p>We hope this scholarship program can enable you to join us and
            contribute to our community!</p>
